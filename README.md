# Mini-Physics-Engine
A 2D (maybe 3D in the future) Physics engine based on the "Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for Your Game" Book by Ian Millington

The engine is obviously not meant for production usage, it's a toy I wrote to help me understand how physics engines work!

# Features
- Various Force Generators: Springs, linear forces etc
- Particles (Collisions)
- Polygons (No Collisions yet)
- Joints (fixed, spring etc.)

# Build Instructions

1. install Armadillo (Maths engine) using cmake
2. install Allegro (Graphics for visualisation) using cmake
3. run `mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..` in the repo's root directory

# Usage

see main.cpp for a demo
